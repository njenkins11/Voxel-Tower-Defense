# Voxel-Tower-Defense

A simple tower defense with talents and power ups! This is still in its very early stages. The goal of this is to provide a light, easy game that has some depth and different ways to play it through various builds.

# Talents

Talents in this game are similair other implimentations. To be more specific, it's close to talent trees, which promotes specific builds. Talent points are used within this talent tree, which are gained by leveling as the game progresses. Note: talents are NOT permanent. They only exist on a game by game basis, thus allowing different builds to be used for every game.

# Power Ups

Power ups, unlike talents, remain permanent. They are bought with gold, which is gained from playing rounds inside of this game. These power ups include damage and attack speed modifiers to all towers, as well as gold and experience modifiers for the player to speed up their game play.
